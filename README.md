# CCGuides
Hi, I'm specificlanguage, and I'm creating guides for a server called [CivClassic.](https://reddit.com/r/civclassic)

  Most of my energy on these guides go into the "Nation Guide" that was created so we could have a better list of reputable nations rather than the ones on the General Recruitment Thread each month. While the Recruitment Thread is a good list, it is mostly self-advertised and not always targeted towards newfriends. The Nation Guide was intended to make a compilation of nations that were repped behind and were good environments for newfriends to grow.
  
  However, another one of my all-time guides is the "Getting Started Guide," a way for newfriends to quickly get started on the server quickly without having to search through the wiki.
  
  Most of these are not very technically driven and written through Markdown, which means this doesn't really have any code. Although I do want to start coding in the future, this repository is just meant to show all my changes, and so people can contribute pull requests to this guide for their own nations, and also suggest changes and resolve inaccuracies in my writing, cause we're not always perfect.
  
  I hope these guides will be a help to many Civcrafters to come.
