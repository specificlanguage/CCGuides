Before you commit on the first nation you see on this list, 

- I recommend you try plenty of these nations on the list and then see if you like it or not.
- And unlike college acceptances, there's a few barriers to join most of these nations and most on this list are welcoming, so try them out before committing. 

Besides, not all of these nations are near to you are they? **I recommend checking out the top nation in each category first, or even finding the nearest nation to you on this list.**

## **Central Nations (closer to 0,0)**

### Gensokyo [(1200, -2500)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=903,-2686,r364#q=Taozi#f=13049855-3ba2-49d9-91b0-86db9580f47f)

Gensokyo is probably most known for being "weeb central," although they make nice buildings too and they hosted the Third Olympics to rousing success. They have two cities; the first is Roe Island, a traditional Japanese village that hosts a huge bathhouse, temple, and a lot more. The other is Taozi, a modern Japanese city that housed the Olympics, home to huge skyscrapers, entertainment complexes, and most of the citizens live here. Gensokyo also fosters community very well, hosting irregular movie and game nights on their discord.

Whether you're returning from older Civ iterations or are completely new to Civ servers, Gensokyo is a great place to get started! Gensokyo has had a long history throughout previous servers and has existed for the duration of CivClassics so far, and they are among the most highly respected on Civclassics.

Public Perceptions:

Bloom prides itself on its rather stable government and amazing buildings, as its capital is a massive trade and infrastructure hub in the southwest. It's one of the more prominent members of the UNC, and regularly holds contentious elections. It also takes in newfriends and encourages other countries to construct embassies and form international relations with other prominent nations on the server.

Its British and European style of government is one of the most well thought out on the server and lends itself well to its architecture and city layout. They record their history a lot and despite regular stints of drama with Icenia who is close by, Bloom tends to be a more levelheaded world player and one of the more reputable nations on CivClassic.

### Icenia [(-1650, -1433)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-1650,-1433,r364)

Icenia one of the more busy yet controversial nations on the server thus far. Led by ChrisChrispie, Icenia's been shown to be in all kinds of antics, like getting a couple of "funny" guys who got exiled from Mount Augusta. It does regularly host elections, but be warned, sometimes debates can get a little spicy. Icenia does give new players quite a bit of support to get started, mainly because of their policy of Universal Basic Income to all citizens. However Icenia also has become the main area of controversy lately so, mind your decisions before joining.

Icenia has had incarnations since Civcraft 2.0, and although not all of them have gone completely smoothly, you can probably count on Icenia being involved on Civclassic. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Icenia) *Warning, wiki page is not complete or up to date.*

### Varkonia [(-4921, -2772)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-4921,-2772,r364#q=Varkonia#f=924bf100-3a6f-4143-b457-8cdc37c317cf)

Varkonia is one of the bigger nations on the server but is one of the more welcoming on Civclassics. It reaches from the top of the server down to the center, but its main capital and great city builds are actually right in the Northwest country. Varkonia is one of the younger nations on the server but has been integral in founding UNC, and shows to be a great broker of peace within the region. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Varkonia)

Besides the capital, another city, Gabon [(-3056, -2309)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-3056,-2309,r364#q=Gabon#f=9005503d-a409-4718-94d0-11dadc0ff286), is worth looking at. Despite being a very large city, it has a very quaint village feel, and its many international rail connections and shops make it one of the most important travel and trade hubs in the region.

Public Perceptions:

- Pros: **Great Builders, Efficient, Helpful to Newfriends**
- Cons: *only a few lingering concerns*

SPQR is a nice nation with a bunch of nice Romans. It tends to be more spread out and their builds much larger than most nations, but damn, when you visit Roma, the size of these lads are actually insane and low-key houses some of the most impressive builds on the server.

SPQR has existed in a capacity since Civ 1.0, and runs into very little drama. They're good people to hang out with. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/SPQR)

## **Southwest (-, +)**

### The Commonwealth (CW) [(-7000, 5000)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-7172,4916,r900#q=Westminster#f=785f1e27-e8cc-4e26-b803-c5b1168ec337)

Situated in the centre of the southwest quadrent, the Commonwealth is a sprawling network of islands, with several cities and smaller settlements scattered among them. This community has twice been voted the world's friendliest; it features a vibrant market, a rich and colourful history, and many magnificent builds across a dozen islands. 

Must see places include [**Albion**](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-7200,3600,r400), a British style city on the northernmost peninsula, [**Taliesin**](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-5688,4641,r400), an up and coming canton colony in the far east, [**Meditat**](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-9200,-5300,r400), a desert oasis with a unique mystical tradition, and [**Westminster**](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-7172,4916,r900#q=Westminster#f=785f1e27-e8cc-4e26-b803-c5b1168ec337), the cosmopolitan cityscape that connects them all, by rail and by royalty.

This version of the Commonwealth was inspired by the iteration from Civcraft 2.0. Many of the same faces return for this version as well. It's had quite a history on the server thus far, and you can [*read more about it here...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth)

Public Perceptions:

- Pros: **Very welcoming towards new players, relaxing, friendly community, little drama** 
- Cons: **Huge, confusing to navigate at first**

### Mount Augusta (MtA) [(-6700, 3000)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-6000,3000,r=400#q=Mount%20Augusta#f=e767a0bc-9df0-4ec1-87b7-f5cb528bb38b)

Mount Augusta has quite a history behind it and it's only getting even more spicier. With regular elections, a massive citizen base and buildings of all styles and sizes, it's a no-brainer choice for many people.

Out of all nations on Civclassic, MtA keeps up the reputation of being the most chaotic. The description of their government is Minarchy, which is essentially anarchy with a small government. So besides some fundamental rules, you can mostly do whatever you want.

This is the fifth iteration of MtA since Civcraft 1.0, and its history really precedes itself. Nowadays it has just enough drama for the common man, and a government to back it up. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta)

Public Perceptions:

- Pros: Chaotic. You can do mostly whatever you want, and there are people around to do it with.
- Cons: Chaotic. You have to figure out for yourself what you actually want, and figure out who will actually help you, and there are people around that will try to stop you.

Yoahtl has always been a controversial nation in Civ, but if you want a community who loves trains and coding  and other things completely outside of Civ, Yoahtl might be the place for you. Besides all the banter and complaining on their discord, they host a number of shops in their Citadel and are the creators of the GOR, a long stretch of overground railroad covering most SATO nations. They've also created the Olympics, now a semi-regular event throughout CivClassic, and they love hosting, creating, and participating in events.

Additionally, [**Pacem**][(-700, 9700)](https://ccmap.github.io/#c=-700,9700,r351) is an autonomous town of Yoahtl but is probably the most visually stunning out of any on this list. The amazing 1900s traditional skyscrapers in the town are some of the most amazing builds on the server, and continually export materials throughout the region. Previously as an independent country, Pacem has created the most high quality posters and now is actively recruiting people for their massive builds like the new Opera House. If you want to get involved in builds and are very good, this is probably your country.

Yoahtl has existed in different iterations throughout but this iteration, and has quite a history this iteration. *Read more* [*about Yoahtl...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Yoahtl) or [*about Pacem...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Pacem)

Formerly a borough of the Commonwealth, Southshire has come into its own after seceding and joining Yoahtl then seceding again into its own nation. Maintaining good relationships with other countries, it has some very fantastic builds and an active playerbase. Its veterans are reputable people among Civclassic and they're nice and friendly. Its citizens love to build, whatever they can, no matter what it is. It has a huge giant giraffe named Melman in its own city!

This is Southshire's first iteration although many still played in earlier iterations. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Southshire)

Although the ++ is mostly empty, Caledonia is in a very nice spot. They are exceptional people and are super productive at what they do. Although it's pretty far out of the way, the town is fantastically built, and is a trade powerhouse for the region. Also, they just annexed Brotherhood of Steel, which, not gonna lie, was dying to get on this list, and they're cool too.

The leaders, Wing and Meat, are very active in the CC community despite being on the other side of the map, and if you're looking for things to do, Caledonia is still a developing nation and would love to have new people like you.

Caledonia was made by former Yoahtlans and are very nice people. [*Read more...*](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Caledonia)

If you wanted a nice, beautiful, rustic and old European city, Vinland is a great fit, but Vinland does a lot more than just that. Its main capital, Hvalsey is always under construction and has some of the most aesthetically pleasing builds in all of Civ. They are a relatively socialist country, but they're always recruiting and it's always worth a stop by! 

Vinland is a founding member of the NCA (Northern Coast Alliance) as well as a member of SATO, and it is a relatively secure nation to live in. [Read more...](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Vinland)

Nyasaland has built quite a name for itself over the last few months on CivClassic. It's more recently come back to power after getting revived, merging, and subsequently leaving its neighbor Annwyn. As a result of getting attacked by terrorists, Nyasaland is one of the most mentioned nations on CivClassic, as well as one of the prettiest. With long accounts of recorded history and the government, drama, and culture to back it up, Nyasaland is a great place to get started.

Iria is one of the genre's oldest surviving civilizations, and also one of its most prolific. Iria has a strong sense of community amongst its citizens, with an emphasis not on war, drama and pvp, but rather, an emphasis on improving home. It's also home to civ's largest ever rail station, Iria International. The capital city of Iria is built the top of a mesa surrounding a valley. The city features builds by noted architects GobblinLord and Retyu. It's a city that looks to the future while still remembering the past, with a number of tributes to past events and builds located in the city. 

Iria was first founded on Civ 2.0 in 2013, and to this day they commit to making cities as beautiful, welcoming and open as they can, wherever they are. [Read more...](https://civclassic.miraheze.org/wiki/Iria)

I tried to make this a curated, trusted, healthy list that has places that are *actually safe* to go to, with no particular fear of danger. **If you have a case for you to be included, don't hesitate to put your advertisement in the comments below.**

I have three other newfriend posts planned which are Coming Soon^(TM) and hopefully I'll actually write them before I get too lazy. If you want to see more of this, please donate to my patreon (lol jk).

Hopefully all of this information helped you which nation to look at. **I strongly urge you not to just join the first one that just sounds good. Visit them, try them out before picking one. Some of these are quite close to each other and most are fun people to hang out in.** 

Additionally if you have any questions, **don't hesitate to put any questions you have about anything below! I'll try and answer as much as I can!** I'll be putting a copy of this on the wiki with more pictures (hopefully) soon, so stay tuned for that.

Thank you all for reading, and happy playing!
